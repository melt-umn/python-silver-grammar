STEPS FOR RUNNING THE PYTHON GRAMMAR

1. Install Silver via the instructions on Silver's website: 
   https://code.google.com/p/silver/downloads/list

Note: Please be sure to follow all installation instructions. The "silver" environment variable should be set.

2. Pull the directory "edu.umn.cs.melt.python/" which contains Main.sv, Python.sv, silver-compile, and PythonTest.py
 

3. Within "edu.umn.cs.melt.python/", type "./silver-compile" and hit enter. A ".jar" file will be generated. This will be refered to as $JAR.

4. Type "java -jar $JAR PythonTest.py" to run the test file
